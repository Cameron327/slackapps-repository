1. Three things that I found interesting that I would like to learn more about is writing code for the Bolt 
framework because I have not done this before, learning that you could do a lot of different things with Bolt 
like deleting chats and creating conversations, and the many uses of Slack apps using its many APIs.

2. Three things that I found difficult to understand were how to use git, how to actually program and utilize 
Bolt for its capabilities, and trying to understand the difference between Slack apps and Slack bots.
